Symptom Tracker is a web app that allows you to track your sypmtoms and medications, along with information about time, intensity, and medication dosage.

It also comes with the option to run seed.rb in order to populate symptom and medication databases with a vast array of medical data.

To get started:
  - run rake db:migrate
  - run rake db:seed (optional)
